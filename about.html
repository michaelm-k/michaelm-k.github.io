					<p>Hey, I’m Michael Marek, a rap-obsessed <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCxvk9NjRKQ&feature=youtu.be&t=37m21s" target="_blank">professional dreamer</a>, who also happens to be a software engineering student at the University of Waterloo!</p>
					<p>Don’t be fooled by the occasional colloquialism however – I also talk technology: casually and seriously. Although I can only speak of gaming in a somewhat past-tense, nostalgic sense, I sure won’t hesitate to engage in an insightful and relevant conversation regarding, say, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, Python, or even C.</p>			
					<p>Some of my other interests include gymnastics, tennis, pop culture in general and, predictably, music. As much as I'd like to play and compose myself, I mainly just listen to it and do research on the industry and its artists. (I am a <s>frequent</s> tracker of the <a href = "http://www.billboard.com/charts" target="_blank">Billboard</a> music charts.)
					<p>Tying into how I like analyzing songs and whatnot, I frequently edit and annotate on <a href="http://genius.com/" target="_blank">Genius</a>.
					<p>Until I can think of something else to say about myself, might I interest you in a light read?</p>
					<p>'Cause I've got a <a href="http://michaelxdave.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> that should provide you with just that.</p>			
					<p>You may also want to take a gander at my <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/michael-marek/a2/2a1/852" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a> or <a href = "Michael_Marek_Resume_201409.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
